# Bounded Core evaluation: L1–L3 + Event Layer

## Decision and boundary

Implement the approved separation as one fixed research-only Terraform scope,
`core`, beside the unchanged `full` default. Core has no L4/L5 provider placement,
resources, Twin projection consumer or Twin-directed federation route. It retains
L3 storage readback. No Terraform `-target`, generic partial-deployment framework,
new architecture profile, UI or relaxation of full-profile admission is needed.

The standalone offline preparer materializes three local and six directed Small
Core scenarios using existing sizing and transport definitions. Directed scenarios
place ingestion at the source and Event Layer, processing and storage at the
destination; this definition is separate from the full-profile matrix and must
not inherit its cost/evidence approvals. Generated inputs are incomplete until
runtime artifacts and an exact supervised plan have been reviewed. They are not
a deployment-ready manifest or a replacement for the Management admission path.

## Implementation and checks

1. Add a fixed Terraform scope guard; reject nonempty L4/L5 placements and
   non-Core routes in Core. Keep the full default unchanged.
2. Remove Twin projection fan-out and publication in Core, including remote
   delivery and its IAM. Retain ingestion, processing, persistence, readback,
   lifecycle storage and core event/control transport.
3. Materialize the nine Small Core input sets offline; no credentials, image
   publishing, live API calls or invented deployment-ready evidence.
4. Run credential-free Terraform mock plans for all nine scenarios, negative
   scope checks, affected runtime tests and existing full-path regressions.
5. Record results and limitations. Before any live mutation, review resource
   inventory, real pinned images, account prerequisites, cost ceiling, time
   limit, destroy and residual inventory for one exact scenario.

## Evidence interpretation

RQ1: reproduce provisioning/configuration and cleanup for the explicitly scoped
Core. RQ2: compare the same Core responsibilities across all three providers;
AWS/Azure L4 and L5 remain separate later evaluations, GCP L4/L5 excluded.
RQ3: measure scoped eventing and actual run costs; do not reuse full-profile
estimates or interpret omitted L4/L5 as zero-cost implementations.

There have been no complete workload E2E runs to repeat. Existing live federation
probes remain historical identity evidence; changed routes/bindings require
current preflight and runtime checks. Affected offline tests/mock plans are
rerun now. The first scoped workload run still needs explicit approval.

## Status

Planned; implementation and offline verification in progress. No live deployment
or paid evaluation is authorized by this document.
