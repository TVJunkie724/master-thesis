# TODOs

- [ ] refactor rest_api.py into multiple files
- [ ] refactor / better structure constants.py (for better readability, organization and maintainability)

- [ ] check upload endpoints, it should be possible to either upload a binary (base64 encoded) or a file by filepath? is filepath feasable?
- [ ] implement TODO functions in AWS roadmap, use roadmap, project code base and technical_specs.md as reference
- [ ] implement error handling with optional parameters (check if implemented in cost optimizer first)

- [ ] update documentation for all changes
