# Project Vision: Twin2MultiCloud

## 1. The Core Vision
**Twin2MultiCloud** is a unified application designed to bridge the gap between theoretical cost optimization and practical multi-cloud infrastructure deployment.

It is not merely an integration of scripts, but a cohesive platform with two interfaces:
-   **CLI**: For automated pipelines and power users.
-   **Flutter Frontend**: For interactive scenario modeling and visualization.

## 2. Theoretical Foundation
The project is strictly based on the scientific framework defined in the paper:
> **EDT_25__CloudDT_engineering.pdf**

This paper establishes:
1.  **The 5-Layer Architecture**: The standard structure for a cloud-based Digital Twin (Data Acquisition, Processing, Storage, Management, Visualization).
2.  **Cost Formulas**: The mathematical models used to calculate and predict costs across AWS, Azure, and GCP.
3.  **Optimization Logic**: The algorithms for determining the most cost-effective provider distribution.

## 3. System Architecture

The system is composed of three distinct but interconnected projects:

### A. The Orchestrator: `twin2multicloud` (App)
*   **Role**: The central hub and user interface.
*   **Interfaces**:
    *   **CLI (`twin2multicloud_cli`)**: A Python-based command-line tool for executing optimization and deployment workflows.
    *   **Frontend (`twin2multicloud_flutter`)**: A cross-platform Flutter application that allows users to visually define twin parameters, view cost comparisons, and trigger deployments.
*   **Responsibility**: It consumes the "Brain" and controls the "Muscle". It holds the user session and configuration state.

### B. The Brain: `2-twin2clouds` (Optimizer)
*   **Role**: The calculation engine.
*   **Input**: Digital Twin scenario parameters (devices, messages/sec, storage retention).
*   **Logic**: Implements the cost formulas from `EDT_25__CloudDT_engineering.pdf`.
*   **Output**: A mathematically optimal multi-cloud configuration (e.g., "L1=GCP, L2=AWS...").
*   **Key Component**: `cloud_price_fetcher` modules that scrape/fetch real-time pricing to ensure the formulas use accurate variables.

### C. The Muscle: `3-cloud-deployer` (Deployer)
*   **Role**: The execution engine.
*   **Input**: The optimal configuration generated by the Brain (via the Orchestrator).
*   **Logic**: Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) logic to provision resources.
*   **Output**: A fully functional, deployed Digital Twin infrastructure spanning multiple clouds.
*   **Key Feature**: Handles cross-cloud "plumbing" (e.g., setting up Pub/Sub to Lambda triggers) automatically.

## 4. The Workflow

1.  **Define**: User defines the scenario in the **Flutter App** (or CLI config).
2.  **Optimize**: The App calls the **Optimizer** (`2-twin2clouds`) to calculate the best path based on `EDT_25` formulas and real-time prices.
3.  **Review**: User reviews the predicted costs and recommended architecture in the App.
4.  **Deploy**: User clicks "Deploy". The App passes the configuration to the **Deployer** (`3-cloud-deployer`).
5.  **Execute**: The Deployer provisions the resources and returns the deployment status/endpoints to the App.

## 5. Future Roadmap

-   **Unified API**: Expose the Optimizer and Deployer as microservices consumed by the Flutter App.
-   **Real-Time Feedback**: The App should display real-time status from the Deployer during the provisioning phase.
-   **Paper Validation**: Use the App to gather real-world cost data from deployed twins to validate and refine the `EDT_25` theoretical formulas.
